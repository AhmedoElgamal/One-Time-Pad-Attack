My approach for the One Time Pad problem:
-----------------------------------------

I made every cipher text XORed with each of the 3 Cipher texts below it XORed with space, 
so we can get the spaces in the first original message in the form of alphabets.

Whenever there is an alphabet in the a spot and alphabet in the below XORed texts in the same spot,
that means there is a space in that spot in the first message,

if we XORed C1 with C2 with Space --> Thats 1 line
same with C1 xor C3 with space --> Thats another 1 line

and in a certain spot in both lines there is an alphabet let's say 'r'in the first line and 'u' in the second line.
then m1 has a space , m2 has letter 'r' in the same spot and m3 has 'u' in the same spot.

I also made a function to get the key so if there are alphabets in all the XORed lines in the same spot,
we XOR the first cipher text with space so that we get the key in that exact spot and use it later to reveal the other lines' alphabets 
in that spot.

At the end, I got most of the alphabets revealed except some which are by default set to '#' symbol (my choice)
I guessed the words and knew the sentences then wrote it in the console log below the semi-revealed sentences.

This is why we shall never use the same key for One Time Pad messages, Its called One Time for a reason.
